The standard definition of "done" in our project means that the feature our group is implementing is fully functional and free of any bugs or issues. This includes ensuring that all requirements are met, the code is thoroughly tested, and it has passed any necessary reviews. This process guarantees that the feature is not only complete but also ready for deployment and use without outstanding concerns.
Once the core functionalities are confirmed and fully functional, we turn our attention to the aesthetics and design improvements. Ensuring the features are operational, it also provides a visually appealing and intuitive experience for the users. This allows us to deliver high-quality features that are both functional and attractive.
