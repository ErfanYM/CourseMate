During sprint0, our team worked together by organizing tasks and roles for each member of the team, making sure everyone takes responsibility for their assigned task. We use Trello for project
management, allowing us to track each members priorities and assign tasks. Furthermore, we use Discord as the primary communication tool for quick and easy discussions between the group. We
also group together for online meetings through Discord due to the applications efficiency and convenience. In terms of decision making, members are encouraged to speak their mind and provide
input and opinions in meetings and discussions in order for the group to come to a discussion collectively. In terms of user stories, we used our decision making technique. Our group met
in-person on campus to come up with ideas for the user stories to make sure everyone's ideas and opinions were heard. Since we all are together outside of our lecture and lab hours, we discuss
about the project often, however in any case, meetings are conducted online through Discord when group members are off-campus. Moving forward, our group can take lessons in improving
communication, and task prioritization. Said lessons are key for the project to be completed successfully, and it's very important to practice as we all aim to continue these practices in
the future.
