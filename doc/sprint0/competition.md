Competitors such as Notion, Slack, Atlassian, etc. have a similar product idea to our CourseMate software. Companies like Notion, Slack, and more provide you with different types of organizational services such as task management, team communication, task organizer, etc. Our company provides users with an all-in-1 service that will all be contained with your own course block. For ex, you have course EECS331, instead of scrolling through your excel sheet due date, or eclass to locate what you need, you will register into CourseMate and create your own customized course block. Within each course block, you can enable and disable certain features, such as pomodoro timer, task manager, notes, organizers, task reminders, classmate communications. CourseMate is a service that provides a little of everything from each task software into one application. Initially, our software will be targeting students in high school or university/college. Competitors mainly focus on tackling one single issue that users need serviced, and making it a perfect solution. Whereas, from a students perspective, we at least know what students need and don't need to be provided as a service. In order for companies to focus on a bigger solution, they would require a lot of research and partnerships within the university to be able to start from something. Whereas a student, we can learn from our experience as soon to be graduates, and analyze what needs to be serviced and what doesn't.
