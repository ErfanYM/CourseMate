Today, we will be demoing our website called CourseMate. We have implemented three features, which include a timer/pomodoro feature, implementing a log in/sign up feature while connecting it to the database aswell, and adding a dark-mode feature to the whole website. Going through each feature, first starting with the timer/pomodoro feature. When clicking on the timer button on the header, we can see that we have a window where the user can select a time for how long to study and how long the user wants to take a break. The next feature of creating an account or signing into a previous account allows the student to save their work on an account, log out and come back to a saved account. Implementing this feature along with a database, allows us to save data for each account under a unique ID. The final feature gives the user the ability to click the 'Dark mode' button and use a darker theme website and press 'Light mode' to go back to a light theme website.

During Sprint 3, our best practices were continue to be communicating and conducting weekly meetings and, in case of emergency, conducting emergency meetings. During the standup meetings, members would each discuss their progress on the task they have chosen to work on, as well as talk through struggles the programmer came across. However, emergency meetings will only be conducted if certain codes fail and need urgent attention or if there are bugs within the code that need to be taken care of. During the sprint, emergency meetings had to be conducted due to 1 or 2 scares involving our local repo and github. One member pushed code to the main branch with error that caused a lot of confusion and stress, making members think that the project has been lost and destroyed. Fortunately, after communicating and troubleshooting, we were able to get the code working and making sure everyone can still access the main branch. We left the meeting understanding how important it is to use different branches so that when a member makes changes, they only push to the secondary branch before merging to the main branch.

As shown on Trello, this sprint tried to focus on working on implementing another creative feature, adding a timer/pomodoro feature and giving the user the ability to log in/sign up and implementing a database in order to save user information on their own specific account. We decided to look more into the user stories on Trello and conduct a meeting based what needs to be added to our application, and what can be changed/removed from the user stories. One trouble that we still have not worked on and decided to leave alone due to delays and no communication with the professor and previous TA is the documentation part of the sprints. In sprint 1, we looked into all the options and we found what we were looking for but when setting up the environment, it keep giving errors. These errors were mainly due to the GitHub repository being made private. We reached out to the previous TA on certain occassions and we still haven't heard from our TA, which is unfortunate because this sets us up for slower progression within each sprint and the whole project.
