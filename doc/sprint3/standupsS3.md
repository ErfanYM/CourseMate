[Nov 23, 2024] Sprint 3 Standup 2

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   - Put some work into the features and completed one of the features. We also looked into the documentation aspect of the project, however the TA assigned to our project still has not responded to any emails and has not given any further information.
2. What do you commit to next?
   - Next commitment is to take it one step at a time, since we are getting into the difficult part of the semester, therefore the goal is to work on another feature before next meeting.
3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - Before the next meeting one more feature will be completed as well as the design aspect should be updated.
4. Do you have any blockers?
   - No blocks, everything seems to be running smoothly on everyone's side. However, the only issue is the documentation. We don't wanna take any further action without the TA's knowing, and in order to take the next action, the TA has to communicate to our group how to setup a documentation.

   - The next goal is to add a timer/pomodoro section to the application.
