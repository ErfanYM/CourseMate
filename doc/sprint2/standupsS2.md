[Nov 11, 2024] Sprint 2 Standup 2

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   - Put some work into the features and completed one of the features. We also looked into the documentation aspect of the project, however the TA assigned to our project
     has not responded to any emails and has not given any further information.
2. What do you commit to next?
   - Next commitment is to take it one step at a time, since we are getting into the difficult part of the semester, therefore the goal is to work on another feature before next meeting.
3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - Before the next meeting one more feature will be completed as well as the design aspect should be updated.
4. Do you have any blockers?
   - No blocks, everything seems to be running smoothly on everyone's side. However, the only issue is the documentation. We don't wanna take any further action
     without the TA's knowing, and in order to take the next action, the TA has to communicate to our group how to setup a documentation.

[Nov 13, 2024] Sprint 2 Standup 3

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   - Up until this meeting, features such as update to design, backend & database, and calendar work has been completed.
2. What do you commit to next?
   - Our next goal is to focus on implementing a Notes section. This feature is a bit of a confusing one, because we want to stick to our project goal of being a study-aid for
     the student rather than throwing tons of new features that they need to learn and may not use in the future. Therefore this feature is something that will be brainstormed
     together with the group.
3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - The next goal is to add a notes section to the application.
4. Do you have any blockers?
   - Nobody has run into blocks since the last meeting.

     video record our work.
3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - By the end of the day on Sunday, Nov 17.
