Today, we will be demoing our website called CourseMate. We have implemented three features, which include a Note taking section, working on the backend/database, and changes within the calendar. Going through each feature, first starting with the note taking section. When clicking on note button on the header, we can see that we have a window where we can input various information in text format. Additionally, The user can use the notes for any occassion such as daily to-do list, jotting down any information, quick reminders, etc. Also demonstrating the backend/database, we use it to save user entries and information in order for it to be stored in case the user reloads or closes the app by accident. New additions to calendar were the updated look on the modula, such as a different design and the addition of choosing which day to add the task to. In addition, we also added different pages for each section of the course.

During Sprint 2, some of our best practices were conducting weekly meetings and, in case of emergency, conducting emergency meetings. During the standup meetings, members would each discuss their progress on the task they have chosen to work on, as well as talk through struggles the programmer came across. However, emergency meetings will only be conducted if certain codes fail and need urgent attention or if there are bugs within the code that need to be taken care of.

As shown on Trello, this sprint tried to focus on working on advancing previous features, adding a notes section and implementing a database in order to save user information. We decided to look
more into the user stories on Trello and conduct a meeting based what needs to be added to our application, and what can be changed/removed from the user stories. One trouble we keep running into
is the documentation part of the sprints. In sprint 1, we looked into all the options and we found what we were looking for but when setting up the environment, it keep giving errors. These errors were mainly due to the GitHub repository being made private. We reached out to the TA on certain occassions and we still haven't heard from our TA, which is unfortunate because this sets us up for slower progression within each sprint and the whole project.
