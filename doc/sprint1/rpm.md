The main goal of the CourseMate project is to deliver a user-friendly and complete platform that contains all necessary tools and equipment for students to manage and organize
their courses, schedules, syllabus, etc. This app will allow students to add and remove course blocks, create and manage a to-do list, attach and view their syllabus for each
course, and more. Students will be able to access all their necessary information and tools within one application rather than having to scramble between laptop folder, eClass,
notebooks, etc.

Key features will include:

- Course Management

  - Ability to add, remove, and edit courses
  - Will be displayed in the home page dashboard

- To-Do List

  - Manage and organize tasks for each course
  - Mark tasks that have a due date complete
  - Will also show on dashboard

- Syllabus
  - User will have option to drop an attachment of their syllabus for each course
  - Seems like a simple feature, but will contain many benefits for the student
- Calendar

  - Add your lecture, tutorial, and lab schedules to your calendar
  - Keep track of when assignments are due, and when you will have your midterm and final

- Pomodoro
  - This is a timer that effectively helps student stay productive within a given period of time, following a 5 mins break, and finally repeat the process 3-4 times
- Clean UI
  - Keeping a clean UI is absolutely important for the student, because keeping a clean interface is a sense of quiet and calm for the human brain
  - If the interface were too contain too much interaction and information in the home page, it can stress out the user and have them looking all over the screen
