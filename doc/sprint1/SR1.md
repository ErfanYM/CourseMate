  
Today, we will be demoing our website called CourseMate. We have implemented three features, which include adding/removing/editing courses, working on the calendar/to list, and within the course page, adding a syllabus customization. Going through each feature, first starting with adding a course. When clicking on the add course button, we can see that we have a window where we can input various information such as course name, number of credits, term, professor name and location. Additionally, in the window we can see a syllabus attachment button, where each student can attach a course syllabus from their computer, which is also one of our features. Also demonstrating the calendar/ to do list feature. We have two buttons where we can go to the previous or the next week. For each day in the calendar we can add a task, where we can input the task information such as task description, related course, and level of priority which we can set. We can save this task and we can also have the option of editing or deleting the tasks, as the user desires.   

During Sprint 1, some of our best practices were conducting weekly meetings and, in case of emergency, conducting emergency meetings. During the standup meetings, members would each discuss their progress on the task they have chosen to work on, as well as talk through struggles the programmer came across. However, emergency meetings will only be conducted if certain codes fail and need urgent attention or if there are bugs within the code that need to be taken care of. 

As we mentioned in trello, for this sprint we tried to work on 3 features and user stories, base on that which is Create to-do list, for each courses, as Students can create task for each day of week they need to for example working on assignments and even not only related to study and they can add their personal task as well. Also we added priority tasks which students can organise based on priority and when they finished tasks they can delete it and go to the next task of the day. And also we added a feature of adding syllabus or any files to any specific course so they can save tons of time and just look into their syllabus over here such as the outline of each course rather than go to eclass to find the outline. In next sprints we are looking forward to add feature that they don’t need to add each task which requires to be on few days together separately and they can add one task for example for tuesday, Friday and sunday by adding it once and also frequent of task and want to repeat it every week or every month etc.. Worst experience we had in this sprint was having trouble to installing react on our three work directory and working in same branch, so our solution for branch is we making new branch or each feature and we work on it independently and we checked on specific branch for specific tasks and if everything was good we merge it with our main branch so we can prevent from occuring any errors in our main code.
